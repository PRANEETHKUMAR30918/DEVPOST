🎯 FundVision – Smart Mutual Fund Recommendation System

Traditional mutual fund selection methods can be overwhelming and impersonal. Investors struggle to find the best options that align with their salary, investment capacity, risk appetite, and long-term goals.

🔍 Collects user data (name, salary, investment amount, risk type, goals)
🤖 Uses ML to recommend funds that fit the user profile
📊 Displays key fund insights: NAV, returns, risk levels, comparisons
